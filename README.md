Project #1: The Game -> Twenty-One

Technologies used:
    - Wireframing, HTML, CSS, Javascript and GitHub
Approach taken:
    - I originally attempted to code game in the way in which it's played, meaning I tried to code the newgameButton first, then the hitButton, and so on and for forth, but I hit alot of obstacles with that approach. At different times it was easier to code certain parts of the game over others based on what I had already coded. Over time I realized it made more sense to code the game in an intuitive manner as ideas arouse intuitively, not by force. Once I switched my approach to an intuitive method I expreienced more inspiration as I coded along and less roadblocks.
